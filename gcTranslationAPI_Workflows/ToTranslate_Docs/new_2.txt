INTRODUCTION
Architectural design guidelines can promote a
greater sense of architectural cohesiveness,
permanence and visual quality at Los Alamos
National Laboratory.

A visually coordinated complex of structures
also contributes to improved wayfinding and
safety and security functions.

The topics covered in this section include:
* Unifying elements
* Building massing
* Building articulation
* Colors and materials
* Specific planning area color palettes

PRINCIPLES
The following principles are the foundation for
the architectural design guidelines:

Building design should reflect the science
and technology environment of the
Laboratory while relating to the climate and
aesthetics of the Southwest and New Mexico.

Buildings should incorporate energy and
resources conservation materials and
systems.

Architectural design controls should be used
to promote visual clarity and cohesiveness
within each planning area.

Building design should incorporate low-
maintenance, fire-resistant materials.

Buildings should be designed to have flexible
space in order to accommodate future uses
or functions.
