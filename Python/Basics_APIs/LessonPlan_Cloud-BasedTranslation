API
A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other, enabling them to exchange data and functionality by defining a standardized way to request and receive information.


SDK
A collection of tools, libraries, and documentation provided to developers that allows them to create applications for a specific platform, operating system, or programming language, essentially offering everything needed to build and run software within that environment.



LLM
An artificial intelligence (AI) system that can understand, process, and generate human language. LLMs are trained on large amounts of data, such as books and articles, using machine learning techniques.

NMT
A method of automated translation that uses artificial neural networks to translate text from one language to another, essentially mimicking the human translation process by learning patterns from large datasets to predict the most likely sequence of words in the target language; a data-driven approach to machine translation considering the entire sentence context rather than just individual words.

IDE
A software application that helps developers write, build, test, and package software.

Cloud Translation API 
	As is 	==> use a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model; general; the standard Google pre-trained model
	Options ==> Adaptive Translation [w/ slightly customized LLMs]
			==> AutoML Translation [w/ highly customized LLMs]

Adaptive Translation
	Creates custom translation models; trains a LLM on small amounts of specialized data; higher degree of accuracy than 
	the standard Google pre-trained model

AutoML Translation 
	Creates custom translation models; trains a LLM on large amounts of specialized data; the most accurate translations possible for highly specialized or technical content; much higher degree of accuracy than the standard Google pre-trained model;  


NB
If you don't want to access an API programmatically, you can access some of the same 
functionality using the tools in Google Cloud CLI or using the Google Cloud console.
