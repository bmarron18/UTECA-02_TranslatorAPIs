-- excerpt from Chapter 10, "The Joy Luck Club"
And just after my father died last year, she said she knew this would happen. Because
a philodendron plant my father had given her had withered and died, despite the fact
that she watered it faithfully. She said the plant had damaged its roots and no water
could get to it. The autopsy report she later received showed my father had had
ninety-percent blockage of the arteries before he died of a heart attack at the age
of seventy-four. My father was not Chinese like my mother, but English-Irish American,
who enjoyed his five slices of bacon and three eggs sunnyside up every morning.
