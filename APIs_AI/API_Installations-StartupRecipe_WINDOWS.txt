		Created
		Plan 			<== Set billing options or use free tier

*	Guard your API Key
	1. Store your API key in a .txt file

Setup Instructions for 
Using OpenAI GPT Models
	Current SDK ==>  openai

https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview
https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart



###################
Setup / Configuration 
of Major Components
on Local Compu
####################

** Install Python
	- Follow the instruction in this website
		https://www.python.org/downloads/
		
		Stable Releases
		Python 3.13.7 - Aug. 14, 2025
			Python-3.13.7.tar.xz				<== Linux
			Download Windows installer (64-bit)	<== Windows
		


** Verify pip installed and updated ("pip" is a Python package manager)
	- pip should already be installed with Python 3.13.7
	- Open a terminal and go to the top of the filesystem
		> cd\
		> pip --version		<== Windows
		$ pip --version		<== Linux
			pip 25.2 from /home/bmarron18/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip (python 3.10)
			
	- upgrade pip
	> python -m ensurepip --upgrade
	
	- If needed, follow the instructions in this website
		https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows
	

** Install Spyder
	- Go to https://www.spyder-ide.org/
	- Spyder will automatically detect your OS and suggest a download
	- define simple location for Spyder install. For example
		/home/bmarron/spyder-6								<== Linux and Mac OS
		C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\spyder-6		<== Windows
		
** Review Windows filesystem operations snippets
	- Open the file, "API_Installations_Windows-Basics.py" in Spyder-6
	- Review the information (snippets) in the large-window on the left-hand side
	- Start at [Command Line Operations in Windows] and scroll all the way through the document


** Find the version of Python running in Spyder-6
	- Locate the IPython Interpreter mini-window in the lower right-hand corner of Spyder-6
	- Scroll to the top of the mini-window to find the Python distribution (distro) information
	- Something like
		Python 3.11.0rc1 (main, Aug 12 2022, 10:02:14) [GCC 11.2.0]
		Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information
	

** Open a terminal and go to your home directory
		$ cd ~							<== Linux and Mac OS
		> cd %homedrive%%homepath%			<== Windows
	
	- Check / find the Spyder installation directory (folder)
		$ find ./ -name "*spyder*" -type d			<== Linux and Mac OS
		> dir /b/s *spyder*						<== Windows
		> where spyder*


** Install the "virtualenv" package (Python) into Spyder directories using pip
	- Open a terminal
	- Install "virtualenv" in specific location in Spyder

	> pip install --target C:\Users\<user-name>\AppData\Local\spyder-6\Scripts virtualenv


      - Verify the installation and locate
		C:\> dir /b/s virtualenv.exe
			C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\spyder-6\Scripts\virtualenv.exe



################################################
Create
	ai-apis			<== a separate python working environment for handling AI APIs through Spyder
					    This is called a virtual environment
Install 
	spyder-kernels 	<== tools to allow Spyder access to a virtual environment
	google-genai 		<== most recent SDK for Google Gemini models
	openai			<== most recent SDK for OpenAI models
	jiter			<== A standalone version of the JSON parser
	nltk 			<== Natural Language Toolkit
###################################################################

*	Specify the use of python 3.11 to create working environment 
	The working (virtual) environment is created with the Python package, in /spyder-6/envs called ai-apis

$ python3.11 -m venv ./spyder-6/envs/ai-apis		<== using python 3.11 to create venv named ai-apis
										./home/bmarron18/spyder-6/envs/ai-apis/pyvenv.cfg
										<== in ai-apis are python 3.10 and 3.11.orc1

> python -m venv C:\path\to\new\virtual\environment


*	Activate the ai-apis virtual environment
	NB. You will see (ai-apis) before at the command line

$ source ./spyder-6/envs/ai-apis/bin/activate


*	Install special packages, Python packages and SDK packages into ai-apis working environment

(ai-apis):~$ pip install spyder-kernels google-genai openai nltk jiter

*	close the ai-apis working (virtual) environment
(ai-apis):~$ deactivate 


#############
Setup Spyder 
to run in the
ai-apis working
environment
##############

*	open Spyder 

*	clic on the "wrench" in the toolbar to open the Preferences window
	- in left-hand column clic on "Python Interpreter"
	- in the right-hand window clic on the button "Use the following interpreter:"
		-- in the empty box search your compu directory until you find the (ai-apis) directory
			(.../spyder-6/envs/ai-apis)
		-- open this directory and find the /bin (\bin) directory
		-- open the "bin" directory and select the "python3.11" icon
		-- at the bottom of the window clic 'Apply' and then 'OK
		-- close the "Preferences" window

*	back in Spyder, find the IPython interpreter window (bottom right)
	- find the tab that says, "Console 1/a"
	- close the tab by clicking on the "X"
	- Spyder will try to re-start Python using "Python 3.11.0rc1" 
		-- if all good, you will see a green-colored "In [1]"
		-- if an Error Box appears something went wrong (try closing and re-opening Spyder)
	
##########
Run API scripts
in Spyder
###########
	
*	You are now ready to access the APIs!
	- in Spyder under the "File" tab find the Python script of interest (a .py file) and open it
	- modify the prompts and run the blocks/cells of interest



#################
Notes on prompts
##################

*	You could think about developer and user messages like a function and its arguments in a programming language.
    	-developer messages provide the system's rules and business logic, like a function definition.
    	-user messages provide inputs and configuration to which the developer message instructions are applied, like 
		arguments to a function.
		- a prompt contains BOTH message types

	instructions parameter (developer messages)
		gives the model high-level instructions on how it should behave while generating a response, including tone, 
		goals, and examples of correct responses. Any instructions provided this way will take priority over a prompt 
		in the input parameter.
		
	input parameters (user messages; as string or array)
		Ant text, image, or file inputs to the model that are used to generate a specific response.
