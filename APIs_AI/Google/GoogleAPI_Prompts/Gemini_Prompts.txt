Notes on prompts
##################

*	You could think about developer and user messages like a function and its arguments in a programming language.
    	-developer messages provide the system's rules and business logic, like a function definition.
    	-user messages provide inputs and configuration to which the developer message instructions are applied, like 
		arguments to a function.
		- a prompt contains BOTH message types

	instructions parameter (developer messages)
		gives the model high-level instructions on how it should behave while generating a response, including tone, 
		goals, and examples of correct responses. Any instructions provided this way will take priority over a prompt 
		in the input parameter.
		
	input parameters (user messages; as string or array)
		Ant text, image, or file inputs to the model that are used to generate a specific response.
