pip install --target /home/bmarron18/virtualenv virtualenv
NO GO for Python 3.11

Issues
##########
**	Cant load google-genai or openai SDKs
PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:
	- google-genai
Current channels:
	- defaults
	
	ANSWER: Install API keys and save as "GEMINI_API_KEY"ENV VARIABLES


** Spyder not opening in spyder_env
Spyder is only available by default in your base . For any other environments you have open in Navigator or your CLI, you may need to install Spyder in that environment.

	ANSWER: Install Spyder separately but needs a python distro!!
	

** (base) $ conda install google-genai 		<== wont work; need Anaconda version
   (base) $ conda install openai 			<== wont work; need Anaconda version
   
   
   $ sudo aptitude install python3-pip
   $ pip install google-genai 	<== install outside of ANaconda
   $ pip install openai 			<== install outside of Anaconda
   
  WARNING: The script tqdm is installed in '/home/bmarron18/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.

#######################
---- Install and Configure Anaconda (installs Python, Spypder, and MANY packages) ----------------
	1. Download the Anaconda distribution for Python to your home computer.
		https://www.anaconda.com/download

	2. Open a terminal
		- use the default terminal in Linux/Mac OS. The terminal is a flashing cursor after a money sign ($)
		(for example, bmarron@bmarron-HP-Laptop-15t-dy100:~$ )
		
		- use a regular terminal (NOT Power Shell terminal) in Windows. Click the Start menu and type "cmd" in the 	
		search bar to find the Command Prompt. The terminal is a flashing cursor after alligator symbol (>) 
		(for example, C:\Users\bmarron\> 
		
		NB. These instructions will show examples in a Linux terminal
		
	3. Open a terminal, and update all Anaconda packages
		$ conda update --all
	
	4. Open a terminal, check Anaconda distro installation, and get ALL the current details
	of the Anaconda distro
		$ conda info 						
	
	5. Open a terminal and check available Anaconda working environments
		$ conda info --envs
		
	6. Open a terminal and activate / deactivate the Anaconda (base) environment (Note change at cursor)
		$ conda activate base
		(base) $ 
		(base) $ conda deactivate
	
	7. Open a terminal, avtivate the (base) working environment and install required 
	SDK packages for the APIs 
		$ conda activate base
		(base) $ conda install conda-forge::openai		
		(base) $ conda install conda-forge::google-generativeai
		(base) $ conda deactivate
		
	
	8. You are now ready to access the API!
		- deactive all Anaconda work envs and close everything
		- open a new terminal, set the Anaconda working env to (base) and open Spyder at the coomand line
		- In Spyder find the Python script ofinterest (a .py file) and open it
		- modify the prompts and run the blocks/cells of interest

7. Open a terminal and create a new Anaconda environment to run AI scripts w/o affecting Anaconda 
	or your computer. The new working environment is named, "spyder_env".
		$ conda create --name spyder_env
		
	8. Open a terminal and check available Anaconda working environments
		$ conda info --envs
		
		For example, you should see something like this
		# conda environments:
		#
		base                   /home/bmarron/anaconda3
		spyder_env             /home/bmarron/anaconda3/envs/spyder_env


2. Open a terminal, and open Spyder at the command line
		$ conda activate spyder_env
		(spyder_env) $ spyder
		
	3. Now in Spyder, in the lower right-hand corner find the IPython Console window
		- Check the version of Python that is running
		- This will be Spyder's internal Python version
		
		(for example,
			Python 3.13.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Sep  3 2025, 14:30:35) [GCC 14.3.0]
			Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
			IPython 8.37.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.
		)
		
	4. Set Spyder to use Python in the new (spyder_env) working environment
		- Clic on Spyder under "wrench" change Python interpreter
		- Opens a new window
		- in left-hand column clic on "Python Interpreter"
		- in the right-hand window clic on the button "Use the following interpreter:"
		- in the empty box search your compu directory until you find the (spyder_env) directory
			(for example, /home/bmarron/anaconda3/envs/spyder_env
		- open this directory and find the /bin (\bin) directory
		- open the "bin" directory and select one of the Python program executable icons
			(for example, /home/bmarron/anaconda3/envs/spyder_env/bin/python)
		- at the bottom of the window clic 'Apply' and then 'OK'
		- close Spyder
		- at the terminal close the (spyder_env) working environment
			(spyder_env) $ conda deactivate
		
	5. Open a new terminal, activate the (base) working environment, check the Python version, and deactivate
		$ conda activate base
		(base)$ python --version
			(for example,
				3.13.5
			)
		(base) $ conda deactivate
		
	6. Open a new terminal, activate the (spyder_env), check the Python version, and open Spyder
		$ conda activate spyder_env
		(spyder_env) $ python --version
			(for example,
				3.13.7
			)
		(spyder_env) $ spyder
		
	7. Now in Spyder, in the lower right-hand corner find the IPython Console window
		- Check the version of Python that is now running
		- This should be the same Anaconda's Python version installed in (spyder_env) but
		  different from Spyder's internal Python version
		7. Open a terminal and create a new Anaconda environment to run AI scripts w/o affecting Anaconda 
	or your computer. The new working environment is named, "spyder_env".
		$ conda create --name spyder_env
		
	8. Open a terminal and check available Anaconda working environments
		$ conda info --envs
		
		For example, you should see something like this
		# conda environments:
		#
		base                   /home/bmarron/anaconda3
		spyder_env             /home/bmarron/anaconda3/envs/spyder_env
