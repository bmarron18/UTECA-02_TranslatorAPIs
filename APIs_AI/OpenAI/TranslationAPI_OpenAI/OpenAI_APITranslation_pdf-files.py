### Translation of mime-type = "application/pdf" files ####

'''
This script will:
1.  Read an English (or any other language) .pdf file.
2.  Construct a clear translator request for an OpenAI model
    (gpt-4o, gpt-5, etc).
3.  Send the request to the OpenAI model.
4.  Write the Spanish (or any other language) translation to 
    a new file type.

Document MIME types available for OpenAI output:
    text/plain   ==> .txt
    text/html    ==> .html
    text/json    ==> ,json
    text/x-tex   ==> .tex

shimmering unicorn, whose horn sparkled with such magic it sent the young 
pirate driftin' to sleep among the stars.
