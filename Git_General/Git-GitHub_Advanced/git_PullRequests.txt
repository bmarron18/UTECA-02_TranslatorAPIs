###############################
QAQC protocol:
tracking repo changes in GitHub
Pull request from a fork
################################
you made the basic mistake after the fork: You didn't created a branch, you worked in master. 
I would never work in master on a fork. Instead I would frequently pull changes from 
original master into my master and work in a branch

	a. FORK the repo needing work
		==> fr. https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/<name-of-your-repo-of-interest>
		==> to https://github.com/bmarron18
	b. make new folder on the Desktop
	c. clone a fresh LOCAL copy of the FORKED repo to the newly-created desktop folder 
 		==> open Git Bash in newly-created folder
		==> $ git clone <GitHub address>
	(d. make a new BRANCH to keep MASTER intact)
	e. repo changes, as needed
	e. check, add, commit, push
	f. generate a Pull request (to Rob) from the forked repo



git status
git remote -v
git add --all  OR  git add -A
git status
git commit
git push origin master
gitk

Create a branch in your existing fork instead of a second fork
Pull request from a feature branch
(when already have fork with changes in 'master' and need push other changes to the GitHub repo)

Creating a pull request from a branch (similar to creating one from a fork):

	a. In the forked repo on GitHub,  browse the history of 'commits'

	b. When find the desired commit of return, click <> ("Browse the repo at this point in the history")

	c. Once historical repo loads, create a NEW BRANCH of this historical repo 
	   (Open "Branch:master" and type in a new branch name, like tmp1)

	d. NOW clone the forked repo only for the given, historical branch
	   by modifying the clone command (can limit history or depth, too)

git clone -b <branch> --single-branch <url> --depth <number of commits>

	e. make changes as usual and then 

git status
git add --all
git commit
git push origin <branch>

	f. Go back to forked repo in GitHub to generate Pull request
	f1. A new, mini-window is open (highlighted in yellow); allows 'Compare and Pull'
	f2. Click green 'Compare and Pull' as usual to create Pull request to original repo
